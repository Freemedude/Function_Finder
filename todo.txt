TODO:
 * Error feedback
    * Seems to be a bug when handling unfinished line quotes
    * Make incorrectly formatted floats to give errors. Currently '1.2.3' returns '1.2', which is should be an error instead.
 * Scanning multiple files/directories
 * Namespaces
 * Add tracing info to hint where a function came from (File and line number?)
 * Add more feedback (Usage etc.)
 * Documentation
 * Cleanup
 * Modernization
 * CMake-ify
 * Blog
 * Ask Chat-GPT for feedback
 * Rename to something other than "preprocessor"
 * Seems volatile to the autoformatter result on client.cpp. INVESTIGATE!
