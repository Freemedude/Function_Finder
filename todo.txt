TODO:
 * Namespaces.
 * Trim whitespace at the end of comments!
 * Ask Chat-GPT for feedback.
 * Blog.
 * Unit tests.
 * More flexible wrapper error handling. If an argument can't be parsed, it shouldn't just be printed. That's useless for applications that don't print to stdout.
 * Add header file documentation at top. Usage etc.
