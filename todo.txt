TODO:
 * Namespaces.
 * Ask Chat-GPT for feedback.
 * Blog.
 * Unit tests.
 * Support for more string types (const char *, char *, std::string_view, const std::string &)
 * More flexible wrapper error handling. If an argument can't be parsed, it shouldn't just be printed. That's useless for applications that don't print to stdout.
